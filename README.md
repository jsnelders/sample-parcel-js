# Parcel.js Sample Project

For the Parcel project at [https://parceljs.org/](https://parceljs.org/).

I just discoverd this today (11 Feb 2020) and had this sampel project up and running in 5 minutes (including typos).

Seriously worth considering from front-end development as an alternative to the bloat of webpack.
